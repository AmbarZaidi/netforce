PART 1
fact a: "Undefined variable: ip"
fact b: "IP: Unable to find IP"
fact c: "ACCESS to protected.php only allowed from IP: 213.75.238.147"
append "?ip=213.75.238.147" to the url

PART 2
changing the url initially didn't give me the answer
so i opened the network tab of my browser inspector
again, i change the url
now the network tab shows me 3 requests
especially the middle one is of interest cause it uses the word "no"
take that url and change it to "yes"
see the password
