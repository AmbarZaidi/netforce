The file given is a zip file.
That zip file is password protected.
From the forums I gather that the password is longer than 5 characters.
So lets start with the simplest case: 6 lowercase letters.

solution.py = a python3 script to get the password and contents of the zipped file (file.txt)
time: about 14mins

solution.sh = shell script to get the password of the zip file
time: about 2mins
