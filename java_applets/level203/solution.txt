When decompiled,
we see a text "Login Success, Loading..", so that is where we want to end up.
After that, an url is build using the value from inuser[1]
inuser[] is filled in the function inFile()
in inFile, a file is read with path coming from inUrl
inUrl gets its value from codebase and a filename
That filename is a concatenation of variable and a string.
The variable is "123" and the string is "pass.txt"
So the file that is read is "123pass.txt"
Append this to the url to see what is inside.
The first line is assigned to inuser[1], which is the value we need.
Change the url to this page.
